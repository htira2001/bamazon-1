Homework Assignment #10 -  Creating an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL - GTCBC 

# Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

An interactive shopping node app where MySQL and Node.JS are used to allow users to purchase items as a customer, view, track and update the product inventory as a manager, and track the total sales by department as an executive.

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.

### Bamazon Customer Portal

The Bamazon Customer Portal allows users to view the current items available for purchase.  The user will be prompted to enter the item id# and how many items they wish to purchase.  If the item is in stock, the order will be completed and the user will see the total amount of their purchase.

### Bamazon Manager Portal

The Bamazon Customer Portal allows users to view and edit the inventory of the store.  The user will be prompted to choose from the following options:
* View products for sale
* View low inventory
* Add to inventory
* Add a new product
